Broken module
=============

Detecting JavaScript comments is hard, at least harder than
just some simple RegExps. New tests show that this module
is not yet fit for purpose.

Now that you have been warned, be invited to look at the broken
version in other branches to improve it with more tests and/or
better comment removal.
